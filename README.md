# Barberotheque

Group project for the Semantic Digital Libraries 2025/26 course.

A digital library of Alessandro Barbero's lectures in audio and text form.

## Process

### Manual search
Searched on YouTube some videos of Alessandro Barbero's lectures and compiled a
csv with basic metadata of each video.

### Audio download
Downloaded the audio of each video using `yt-dlp` into M4A format.

```shell
# extract all youtube URLs into a batch file
tail -n +2 data/barbero.csv | cut -d',' -f1 > barbero.lst

# download m4a audio files with yt-dlp
yt-dlp \
  --format bestaudio[ext=m4a] \
  --sleep-interval 30 --limit-rate 5M \
  --extract-audio --audio-format m4a \
  --download-archive barbero.log --batch-file barbero.lst \
  --output "audio/barbero-%(extractor)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s"
```

### Semantic renaming
Compiled the `data/barbero.csv` with the reasoned semantic filenames, adding the
column `semantic_filename` and filling it manually.
Then renamed all files in the `compressed/` folder to their semantic filenames
using the script `scripts/rename_files.py`.

### Whisper transcription
Transcribed each audio file using OpenAI Whisper in Italian language using the
`turbo` model.

```shell
for file in audio/*.m4a; do
  whisper "$file" \
    --model turbo \
    --language it \
    --task transcribe \
    --output_format all \
    --output_dir transcripts/
done
```

### Keywords/entities extraction
Extracted keywords and named entities from each transcript txt file using SpaCy
NLP model for italian (`it_core_news_lg`), saving the results as CSV files in
the `keywords/` and `entities/` folders.

```shell
python scripts/keywords.py
```
